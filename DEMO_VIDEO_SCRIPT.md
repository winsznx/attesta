## 📋 RECORDING CHECKLIST

### Before Recording:
- [ ] Clear disk space (CRITICAL!)
- [ ] Start both ICP backend and frontend
- [ ] Test complete flow once
- [ ] Clear browser cache and console
- [ ] Prepare test data (title, description)
- [ ] Have wallet ready for payment demo
- [ ] Practice the script 2-3 times

### Screen Recording Setup:
- [ ] Use OBS Studio, Loom, or QuickTime
- [ ] Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- [ ] Frame rate: 30 FPS minimum
- [ ] Show cursor
- [ ] Record browser + console (split if possible)

### Audio:
- [ ] Use good microphone (or built-in if clear)
- [ ] Quiet environment
- [ ] Clear, enthusiastic voice
- [ ] Speak at medium pace (not too fast!)

### What to Show on Screen:
1. **Dashboard**: Clean, with Constellation status visible
2. **Console**: Browser DevTools showing validation logs
3. **Code**: VS Code with key files (optional but impressive)
4. **Candid UI**: ICP canister interface (quick show)

### Key Talking Points:
✅ Multi-chain (ICP + Constellation + Ethereum)
✅ Production mainnet deployment (not just local!)
✅ Real HGTP protocol implementation
✅ AI generation with X402 payments
✅ Professional code quality

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
❌ Going over 2 minutes
❌ Spending too long on one feature
❌ Technical issues (test everything first!)
❌ Mumbling or unclear speech
❌ Not showing the multi-chain validation
❌ Forgetting to mention mainnet deployment

## 🎥 PRO TIPS

1. **Speed**: Speak clearly but move quickly between features
2. **Energy**: Be enthusiastic! Judges watch many videos
3. **Show, Don't Tell**: Let the live demo do the talking
4. **Highlight Uniqueness**: Emphasize multi-chain integration
5. **Production Ready**: Stress that it's on mainnet, not just local

## 🎬 ALTERNATIVE: 2-MINUTE QUICKFIRE FORMAT

If you want even more impact, use this structure:

**0:00-0:20** - Problem + Solution
- "Legal agreements lack trust. Attesta solves this with triple blockchain verification."

**0:20-1:00** - Live Demo (no talking, just screen recording)
- Fast-forward through agreement creation
- Show all 3 chains validating

**1:00-1:30** - Technical Excellence
- Quick code snippets
- Show mainnet canister IDs
- Show Constellation network status

**1:30-2:00** - Why It Wins
- Multi-chain (unique)
- Production ready (mainnet)
- Real HGTP implementation
- Beautiful UI + great UX
